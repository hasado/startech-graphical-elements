= StarTECH graphical elements

Contains the graphical elements of the StarTECH Java (stickers, logo, etc.)

== Logos

All StarTECH logos were done using www.getpaint.net/[Paint.net] (`.pdn` extension for all working files).

== Stickers

The StarTECH Duke artisan stickers were done using https://inkscape.org/fr/[Inkscape] (`.svg` extension for all working files).

To see all the work layers in the svg file, you need to open it using the *Inkscape open feature*, and *not* by drag & dropping the file in the software.
